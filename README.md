# Project-Cipher-Text
The project focuses on implementing various ciphers, including the Caesar cipher and the Vigenère cipher. It also involves string manipulation and algorithmic decryption techniques. The project has several tasks:
1. Implementing string utility functions like finding the index of a character in the alphabet and rotating characters or strings.
2. Implementing the Caesar cipher encryption and decryption, where  each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number.
3. Implementing the Vigenère cipher encryption, where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a different amount based on a keyword.
4. Implementing the Caesar cipher decryption using brute force and dictionary comparison to find the most likely decryption.
